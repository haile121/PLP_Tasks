Part 1: Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?
AI-driven code generation tools reduce development time by automatically suggesting code snippets, completing boilerplate code, and providing context-aware recommendations. Developers can focus on higher-level logic rather than repetitive coding.
Limitations:

AI-generated code may contain errors or security vulnerabilities.

Suggestions may not fit specific project contexts.

Human review is required to ensure correctness.

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

Supervised Learning: Trains on labeled datasets of known bugs to predict future bugs. Accurate if labels exist but requires manual labeling.

Unsupervised Learning: Identifies anomalies in code without labeled data. Useful for detecting unknown bug patterns but may produce false positives.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?
Bias mitigation ensures AI models provide fair and equitable experiences to all users. Without it, some groups may be disadvantaged or misrepresented, reducing trust and usability.
